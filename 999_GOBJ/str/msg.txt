Oh... I see you are leaving...
Mmmmh... Sometimes, giving up is an answer to some issues...
Ok, you can give up, I guess this game is not about competitivity...
I do not respect people who can't finish such a small game...
Ok, you're not worth me to speak but I accept, consider this forgiveness.
I despise you.
Eeerk !

I just don't want to play with you, I'm pretty sure you would ruin my gameplay being so good...
Bro isn't kidding...
Amazing!!!!
You won, but what about next time ?
***----***
Maybe try an easier dungeon, don't you mind?
Maybe you are too weak for these enemies... ?
Maybe trying to cheer up with these creature wasn't a good idea...
You were killed by an enemy.
These small things can bite... Try dodging'em.
